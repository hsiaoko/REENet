# REENet
Torch-based, implementation of similarity classification that identity two tuples with the same semantic similarity. It return true if two tuples are referring as the same real world entity.


Instructions
-------
```
1. Train embeding model by source code provided "./python/train".
2. Train classification model by source code provided by "./pyhton/train_classifier.py"
3. Copy your classification and embeding models to "./models/"
4. Bash: mkdir build & cmake ..
```
